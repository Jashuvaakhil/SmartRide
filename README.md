🚗 RentoHub

RentoHub is a web-based vehicle rental application that I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to browse different cars, bikes, and EVs, book vehicles for specific dates, and even view a digital key after booking.

This project helped me understand how frontend systems work together with local storage, form validation, and dynamic rendering using JavaScript.
